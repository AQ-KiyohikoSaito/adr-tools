 * creates the first ADR in that subdirectory, recording the decision to
   record architectural decisions with ADRs.

+ for c in '$(_adr_commands)'
+ adr help new
usage: adr new [-s SUPERCEDED] TITLE_TEXT...

Creates a new, numbered ADR.  The TITLE_TEXT arguments are concatenated to
form the title of the new ADR.  The ADR is opened for editing in the
editor specified by the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variable (VISUAL is
preferred; EDITOR is used if VISUAL is not set).  After editing, the
file name of the ADR is output to stdout, so the command can be used in
scripts.

Options:

-s SUPERCEDED   A reference (number or partial filename) of a previous
                decision that the new decision supercedes. A Markdown link
                to the superceded ADR is inserted into the Status section.
                The status of the superceded ADR is changed to record that
                it has been superceded by the new ADR.

E.g. to create a new ADR with the title "Use MySQL Database":

    adr new Use MySQL Database

E.g. to create a new ADR that supercedes ADR 12:

    adr new Use PostgreSQL Database -s 12
+ adr help nonexistent-command
grep: /Users/nat/projects/adr-tools/src/adr-nonexistent-command: No such file or directory
